# Embedded System

This project is a Arduino based code, that uses a HostShield to controll a 3D printer configured by Marlin.

### To controll the printer you have to run the code on the Arduino, and connect the HostShield to the printer.
### Then, all you need to do is open the serial monitor on the arduino IDLE, and write the GCode with the command you want.

# Here are some examples:
```
Move the printer in the X axis for the left: A
```
```
Move the printer in the X axis for the right: D
```

```
Move the printer in the Y axis to move foward: W
```

```
Move the printer in the Y axis to move foward: S
```
